README for Libro
================

INTRODUCTION

Libro is a very simple library card catalog system.  The primary
purpose of the application is to illustrate the common idioms I use
when building applications using the features of the te-common Java
Edition.

I have tried to write this application using the techniques for
producing production-grade code.  This specifically includes localized
message resources, exception handling and a complete build
environment.

This library uses the Jaxor O/R mapping framework to provide database
capabilities and the HSQL database to provide the actual database
functionality.  The SQL written should be compatible with any SQL-92
compliant database server except where noted.

While this application may eventually provide useful functionality,
that is not it's primary purpose.  The main focus of this application
will continue to be how to properly use te-common within a "real"
application.

BUILDING

To build the system, copy the build.properties-sample to 
build.properties and edit it to suit your own configuration.  Once
this has been done, simply build the system using ant.

RUNNING

Currently, there is not enough of the system in place to run.
